# C# Homework Repository

This repository contains C# solutions for various homework assignments by Vahe Mirzoyan, under the guidance of Lecturer Albert Darbinyan.

## Homework List

Task1.  Show the horse strokes in the matrix [8,8]

Task2.  Show the queen strokes in the matrix [8,8]

Task3. Randomly place queens on the chessboard so that they do not hit each other.

Task4. The horse (knight) will step from the mentioned field with random free fields once.

Task5. Saddle point. Given an MxN integer size matrix. Determine and find the matrix element that is largest in its row and smallest in its column. If no such element exists, display the message "no".

Task6. Randomly fill non-repeating numbers in an NxM matrix.

Task7. Queen placement in Matrix [8,8] with heuristic method. Place queens on a chessboard so that
they do not hit each other, using the heuristic of maximum free for queen fields. Display the current results
of the heuristic run. Explanation in more detail in the classroom.

Task8. Knight moving in Matrix [8,8] with heuristic method. Any next move of the knight in the free
field is selected by a special template with mninimum value. Template is the number of knight moves in the
initial chessboard. Display the current results of the heuristic run. Explanation in more detail in the
classroom.
